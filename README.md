# be-more-social
An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

## Description
An API application for a social network web app that allows users to share their opinions, react to the thoughts of their friends, and construct a friend list. For routing, I utilized Express.js, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to Express.js and Mongoose, I formatted timestamps using a JavaScript date library.
